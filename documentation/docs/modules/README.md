# Modules
<!--{h1:.massive-header.-with-tagline}-->

> Outsider & Generic

- **Generic** AMD Modules
- **Doesn't need** to be Jails dependent
- It can use **Jails** module

Think as generic Modules which can be used on other projects without **Jails**. You can use them to extend your Application, Controllers and Components with new behavior, or augmenting it with new abstractions.

Some ideas on what can be solved using a Module on Jails:

- Models
- Routers
- Storage Wrappers
- Http Wrappers ( Ajax, JSONP, etc )
- Cookies modules
- Caching Systems
- Etc, etc...

Please, take a look at some official Jails modules at: [jails-org.github.io/Jails/modules](http://jails-org.github.io/Jails/modules.htm)
