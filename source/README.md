> Functional & Event Driven Micro-Framework

A simple way to abstract your applications using the same DOM event way to communicate all the parts of your application.

## Introduction

The most known way to abstract web applications seems to be all about **MVC** architecture.
It is a widely accepted architecture in *Back-End* environment and desktop applications. But it turns out that is pretty much hard to actually maintain that pattern on *Front-end* environment and it does not scale using that closed concept of communication of these 3 structures on Javascript and Web environment.

Jails tries to change paradigm, it focus on `functional` and `modular` architecture, and uses a very known way by all Javascript programmers to wire up your modules: **Events**.

## Jails-org

> We do not have the pretension to build the best modules, so we do need your help.

The idea of Jails is to compose your application using the excellent libraries out there, we believe that the more composable your application is, the more efficient and maintainable it will be.

The main concept here is not ship the Micro-Framework loaded with several functionalities you might not need, Jails should grow up with community so you can write `modules` and `components` and share them, **you don't have to wait** Jails future releases to use a different view engine or a better router. Fell free to join us, helping us to improve or create new modules and components.

There are some useful components and modules in the official repository, if you want to improve them or share new ones, we would be very happy with your contribution.
